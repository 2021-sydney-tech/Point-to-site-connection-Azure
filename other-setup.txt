I will use Azure PowerShell cmdlets on Windows 10.

Step a: open open a Windows PowerShell console. It does not work in the Azure Cloud Shell. so I need to run it locally.
Step b: Sign in using the Connect-AzAccount cmdlet.
        For my case, the Powershell on my Windows does not does not recognised the name of a cmdlet, funtion, script fi operable program.
        So I have to install the latest version of PowerShell available for your operating system.
        
        Follow this instruction to install latest version of PowerShellhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-7.0.0

        After than I will be able to sign in Azure portal

Step c: Create a self-signed root certificate
        Generate a client certificate
        To view the certificate by opening certmgr.msc, or Manage User Certificates.
